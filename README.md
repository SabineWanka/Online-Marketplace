Online-Marketplace

A marketplace that allows users to view products from Best Buy. 
The user will be able to view details about the product, and if they decide, add the product to a shopping cart.

Includes the following pages:

  * A Home page that displays "top" products. The user should be able to search for keywords.

  * A Shopping Cart page that displays all items in their cart. Users should be able to remove items from their cart, view a subtotal, and adjust quantities of each item in their cart.
